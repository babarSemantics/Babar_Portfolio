                        <li>QAT SNAP application is created in Java and Android SDK to facilitate the QAT conduction monitoring team and ADU.</li>
                        <li>It makes data entry of QAT monitoring schools easy.</li>
                        <li>The automatic report generation helps the monitoring team to evaluate the school on set measures.</li>
                        <li>Benefits to the system being replaced by the application to be developed would be a system that is easier to use and also much faster than the previous system.</li>
                        <li>This app makes it easier to use the monitoring process and possibly saves a lot of money due to the reduction of needed resources as compare to the old manual system.</li>
                        <li>The proposed system is secured by registering the device id with the monitor's profile so that no one can temper the data..</li>
